SW: did you test your code? it doesn't work as written. I've modified it to get it to knit together; in particular, I've added code to explicitly load the two libraries you need. you also need to consider the absolute value of the correlation coefficient; right now, you're only catching positive values. in general, though, this is good work. the assignment mentions binary variables, and your code should anticipate and handle them. for example, in the `mtcars` data set, the variable `am` is binary, which is essentially a logical vector.
